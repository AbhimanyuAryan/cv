Personal Statement
------------------

My name is Antonio C Nalesso Moreira, I have two nationalities
Brazilian and Italian, I live in London UK.
I am a junior web developer who does come freelance developement
who's looking to continue my career within agency side development.
I have good coding skills as well as software engineering practices
& best practices. I tend to write modular code which makes it easier
to test and to avoid certain types of [connascence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connascence_(computer_programming)).
I consider myself a Classical and a Mockist TDD/BDD practitioner.
Most of my time I am learning something new, in the pursuit
of a good prototype.

I also spend most of my time reading someone else's code,
It's absolutely incredible how much we can learn from reading
their code rather than just following documentation.
I have been doing [RoR](http://rubyonrails.org/) for one
and a half year. I tottaly felt in love with Ruby when I was
watching [Dave Thomas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Thomas_(programmer)) talk.
It took me a while to understand how Metaprogramming works
however once one understands how self works in Ruby it all makes sense,
as Dave Thomas explains in [this](http://scotland-on-rails.s3.amazonaws.com/2A04_DaveThomas-SOR.mp4) video.
I like keeping things simple but not too simple.

Personal Interests
------------------
I like going swimming at least twice a week, inline staking or
ice skating almost every morning.
I like building awesome stuff for awesome people. That's what
I say whenever somebody asks me what I do for a living...
I am currenlty learning C (ASCII) in my spare time, as I want to
help the Ruby source code, The Linux Kernel, and create my own stuff
in C which can be a lot of fun.

I have a particular interested of reading books back in the days
that we only had Simula, Lisp, or Smalltalk.
There are great concepts one can learn from reading those books.

Free Software Coding, I love doing it, I am a maintainer of a Rails'
engine called [impressionist](https://github.com/charlotte-ruby/impressionist).
