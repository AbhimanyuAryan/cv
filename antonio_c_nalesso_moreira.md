Personal Statement
------------------

My name is Antonio C Nalesso Moreira, I have two nationalities
Brazilian and Italian, I live in London UK.
I am a junior web developer who does come freelance developement
who's looking to continue my career within agency side development.
I have good coding skills as well as software engineering practices
& best practices. I tend to write modular code which makes it easier
to test and to avoid certain types of [connascence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connascence_(computer_programming)).
I consider myself a Classical and a Mockist TDD/BDD practitioner.
Most of my time I am learning something new, in the pursuit
of a good prototype.

I also spend most of my time reading someone else's code,
It's absolutely incredible how much we can learn from reading
their code rather than just following documentation.
I have been doing [RoR](http://rubyonrails.org/) for one
and a half year. I tottaly felt in love with Ruby when I was
watching [Dave Thomas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Thomas_(programmer)) talk.
It took me a while to understand how Metaprogramming works
however once one understands how self works in Ruby it all makes sense,
as Dave Thomas explains in [this](http://scotland-on-rails.s3.amazonaws.com/2A04_DaveThomas-SOR.mp4) video.
I like keeping things simple but not too simple.

Personal Interests
------------------
I like going swimming at least twice a week, inline staking or
ice skating almost every morning.
I like building awesome stuff for awesome people. That's what
I say whenever somebody asks me what I do for a living...
I am currenlty learning C (ASCII) in my spare time, as I want to
help the Ruby source code, The Linux Kernel, and create my own stuff
in C which can be a lot of fun.

I have a particular interested of reading books back in the days
that we only had Simula, Lisp, or Smalltalk.
There are great concepts one can learn from reading those books.

Free Software Coding, I love doing it, I am a maintainer of a Rails'
engine called [impressionist](https://github.com/charlotte-ruby/impressionist).

Pursuit to become a professional developer
------------------------------------------

I was doing php when a friend of mine told me about Ruby and Ruby on Rails, in fact I started
learning Rails just for fun. I tried to learn Rails without knowing much about Ruby and that was
totally wrong, once I learnt a little bit of Ruby I felt in love with it. It's syntax, expressiveness, its
different way of doing things, I'd never thought I could write an if statement in line and most
important its community.<br />
Rails was in its 3.0 version,I bought a book called The Rails 3 way ( Obie Fernandez ) this book
taught me a lot, I got a freelance job soon after and this book helped all my way through this project
( ziggybull.com ). I had to learn how to deploy a Rails App, how to configure Passenger web server,
some rake commands to pre-compile assets or create a database etc...<br />
Yes it was a mess, I did not know about Keep your Controllers clean move your logic into your
Models, but I started to learn something new about rails every day. I realised that I couldnâ€™t carry on
any more without knowing more about Ruby, so I bought two books called Programming Ruby 1.9
( Dave Thomas, Andy Hunt and Chad Fowler ), Ruby ( Peter Cooper ), these two books have helped
me to understand how things work in the Rails source code and it changed drastically the way I
write Ruby code now days.<br />
I became a TDD/BDD practitioner few days later, I could not buy the idea of writing a failing test
then watch it fail then write just enough code to make it pass at first. I then read another book The
Rspec book, which has a section about cucumber, this book, a lot of googling, and some other
books such as XP Programming ( Kent Beck ) taught me how to do TDD/BDD right and I am now
a TDD/BDD evangelist, but I am still learning it, I guess learning TDD/BDD is like learning
Cohesion and Coupling you will never stop.<br />
I have learnt how to design my apis from the outside-in, which teach us to write just enough code to
get that particular feature done rather than write a whole new library.
I love making things testable now, it makes me confident that my code works. I do use a lot of
mocking and stubbing in my Unit tests, as I think they should be tested in isolation. I do not connect
to the database every time to test, I'd use FactoryGirl or just Fixtures.<br />
I then became maintainer of a Ruby Gem called Impressionist, which is a Rails mountable Engine,
that was also my first experience using Git, Github and Rubygems, I had to learn about Semantic
Version, how to create rails generators, how to deal with other developers as they'd fill up an issue
whenever they had found one.<br />
So I was going from a beginner to a experienced rails developer, then there was another opportunity
for me to work as freelance ( jibin.co.uk ).
This website was much easier to develop, I knew what I was doing and I was confident.
I used someone's gems to speed me up, such as devise, I used Rspec and Capybara to test it.
I was studying English at Greenwhich Community College and working at Waterfront Leisure
Centre at this time, therefore I did not have a lot of spare time to spend in it.
Few days ago I went in to a company's office asking for job, they gave me their tech test to do but
they also told me that they're not hiring now but he wanted me to do the tech test and as soon as
they start hiring, which is next year, he will call me back.<br />
I have another freelance project about to start, this is for a Talent Agency, which will be two friends
and I developing, I will be only doing the back-end, not the entire website though.
I do not have a lot to content to show right now, as in terms of websites developed.
However I know I am a great developer and I am not afraid to run myself into new problems,
because this is how we learn, I am not scared of failing I know I might fail that's why I value
communication amongst team as the most important thing.<br />
I am currently learning Sinatra, Rack and crafting my testing and Ruby skills.
