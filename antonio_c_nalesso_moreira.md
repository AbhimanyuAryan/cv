About me
--------

My name is Antonio C Nalesso Moreira ( aka <code>acnalesso</code>), I have two nationalities
Brazilian and Italian,<br />I live in London UK.<br />
I am a junior web developer who does come freelance developement
who's looking to continue my career within agency side development.<br />
I have good coding skills as well as software engineering practices
& best practices. I tend to write modular code which makes it easier
to test and to avoid certain types of [connascence](http://goo.gl/hXed97).<br />
I consider myself a Classical and a Mockist TDD/BDD practitioner.<br />
Most of my time I am learning something new, in the pursuit
of a good prototype.

I also spend most of my time reading someone else's code,
It's absolutely incredible how much we can learn from reading
their code rather than just following documentation.<br />
I have been doing [RoR](http://rubyonrails.org/) for one
and a half year. I tottaly felt in love with Ruby when I was
watching [Dave Thomas](http://goo.gl/DGMOtu) talk.<br />
It took me a while to understand how Metaprogramming works
however once one understands how self works in Ruby it all makes sense,
as Dave Thomas explains in [this](http://scotland-on-rails.s3.amazonaws.com/2A04_DaveThomas-SOR.mp4) video.<br />
I like keeping things simple but not too simple.<br />
I am also a NINJA willing to protect the company that's going to hire me!

Personal Interests
------------------
I like going swimming at least twice a week, inline staking or
ice skating almost every morning.<br />
I like building awesome stuff for awesome people. That's what
I say whenever somebody asks me what I do for a living...<br />
I am currenlty learning C (ASCII) in my spare time, as I want to
help the Ruby source code, The Linux Kernel, and create my own stuff
in C which can be a lot of fun.<br />

I like reading books back in the days that there only were Programming languages such as
Simula, Lisp, or Smalltalk.<br />
There are great concepts one can learn from reading those books.

Free Software Coding, I love doing it, I am a maintainer of a Rails'
engine called [impressionist](https://github.com/charlotte-ruby/impressionist).
